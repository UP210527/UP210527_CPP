Explanation.
Ask the user for his annual rent.

Check that the user entered a valid rent.
2.1 If the user does not enter a valid rent, print a message that the user entered an incorrect number.
2.2 If the user entered a valid rent, continue with the program.

Check by several if's which tax rate.
3.1 If the rent is less than $10, 000 it is 5% (.05).
3.2 If the rent is greater than or equal to $10,000 and less than $20,000 it is 15% (.15).
3.3 If the rent is greater or equal to $20,000 and less than $35,000, it is 20% (.20).
3.4 If the rent is greater or equal to $35,000 and less than $60,000 it is 30% (.30).
3.5 If the rent is greater than $60,000 it is 45% (.45).

Multiply the rent by the tax rate.

Print the tax rate and its equivalent in dollars.

Explanation.
Ask the user for your age.
Check that the user enters an age within the following range.
2.1 If the user enters an age lower than 0, a message "Your age is invalid" will be printed.
2.2 If the user enters a number between 4 and 0, the ticket price is 0.
2.3 If the user enters an age greater than 4 and less than 18, the ticket price is 5.
