I leave you this link about my work evidence of the flowchart (https://lucid.app/lucidchart/ebb9fdd4-c8cb-40f5-b7c5-ea7dc5f1e29d/edit?view_items=~z-_Fpn3bh87&invitationId=inv_3064f422-67ce-4d92-8bbf-e447df5b55c4)

# Development and explanation

# things to take into account
1. Do not write numbers with decimal point or letters when asking for the move, as the program crashes
2. In single player mode the player is "O" and the PC is "X".
3. In multiplayer mode player 1 is "O" and player two is "X".
# Conclusion
